# categorize_stonk_headlines
Categorize stonk headlines from yahoo finance using spacy, pycaret and multiclass classification

So the thought process behind this project is to use spacy to categorize news events of interest and leveraging a "adjusted" trained dataset, I can personalize the selection results. 

Going to stick with classification with spacy for now and check the performance.
